# Release v0.7.4: Consumer Group Coordination & Fetch API Stability

## Overview
This release represents a fully tested and stable version of the Consumer Group coordination fixes and FetchResponse improvements originally introduced in v0.7.3. All changes have been thoroughly validated with comprehensive test suites.

## üéØ Key Features

### Consumer Group Coordination - Production Ready
- **Partition Assignment**: Fixed SyncGroup handler to properly compute and distribute partition assignments using round-robin strategy
- **Leader Election**: Enhanced leader-based assignment computation when empty assignments are provided
- **Offset Management**: OffsetFetch now returns appropriate default offsets (0) for new consumer groups
- **State Machine**: Improved consumer group state transitions for reliable rebalancing

### FetchResponse Protocol Compliance
- **No More Client Crashes**: Resolved critical issue where kafka-python would crash when polling past topic end
- **Spec-Compliant Encoding**: FetchResponse now returns properly formatted empty byte arrays instead of NULL
- **Iterator Mode Support**: Full compatibility with consumer iterator patterns
- **Empty Response Handling**: Correct serialization of partitions with no available messages

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` in kafka-python
- Resolved partition assignment distribution issues in consumer groups
- Fixed OffsetFetch returning incomplete partition data
- Corrected FetchResponse binary encoding for empty record sets

## ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing
- Added 4 new test files validating consumer group functionality
- Tested with kafka-python v2.0.2
- Validated iterator mode operation
- Confirmed multiple polls past topic end work correctly
- Verified round-robin partition assignment

## üì¶ What's Changed Since v0.7.2
- Enhanced `consumer_group.rs` with proper assignment computation
- Improved `fetch_handler.rs` for correct empty response handling
- Updated `handler.rs` protocol encoding for empty records
- Enhanced `kafka_handler.rs` with comprehensive offset management
- Added extensive logging for debugging consumer group operations

## üîÑ Compatibility
- Full compatibility with kafka-python
- Compatible with confluent-kafka
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing Chronik Stream clients
- Drop-in replacement for Apache Kafka in consumer group scenarios

## üöÄ Impact
Organizations can now confidently use Chronik Stream as a Kafka replacement with standard client libraries:
- Scalable message consumption with consumer groups
- Reliable offset management and commits
- Robust error handling without client crashes
- Production-ready consumer group coordination

## Upgrade Notes
No breaking changes. This is a drop-in replacement for any v0.7.x version. The release includes:
- All fixes from v0.7.3
- Additional stability improvements
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Testing
The release includes a complete test suite in the `compat-tests` directory:
- `test_consumer_group.py` - Consumer group coordination tests
- `test_iterator_mode.py` - Iterator pattern validation
- `test_basic_consume.py` - Basic consumption tests
- `test_consumer_groups_full.py` - Comprehensive test suite

All tests pass successfully, confirming production readiness.
