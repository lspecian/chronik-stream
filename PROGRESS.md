# Chronik Stream - Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Setup Rust Project Structure and Dependencies
- Created workspace with 9 crates
- Configured dependencies (avoiding AGPL licenses)
- Set up proper module structure

### ✅ Task 2: Implement Chronik Segment Format
- Created segment format that combines Kafka data with search index
- Implemented serialization/deserialization with header, metadata, Kafka data, and index sections
- Added storage key generation for object storage paths
- Full test coverage for segment operations

### ✅ Task 3: Implement Object Storage Abstraction Layer
- Built unified abstraction using OpenDAL
- Support for S3, GCS, Azure Blob, and local filesystem
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added prefix support for multi-tenancy
- Comprehensive test suite for storage operations

### ✅ Task 4: Implement Kafka Wire Protocol Parser
- Created protocol parser for Kafka binary format
- Implemented encoder/decoder for all primitive types including varints
- Built request/response header parsing
- Added API version negotiation support
- Created protocol handler with ApiVersions support
- Full test coverage for protocol parsing

## Next Tasks

### Task 5: Implement Raft Consensus for Controller Nodes
- Integrate openraft for leader election
- Implement controller state machine
- Handle partition leader assignments

### Task 6: Setup PostgreSQL Metastore Schema
- Design schema for topics, segments, ACLs
- Create migration scripts
- Implement type-safe queries with sqlx

### Task 7: Implement Ingest Node TCP Server
- Build TCP server with TLS support
- Handle Kafka client connections
- Integrate with protocol handler

### Task 8: Implement Real-time Indexing Pipeline
- Create in-memory Tantivy indexing
- Support schemaless JSON indexing
- Buffer management and flushing

### Task 9: Implement Produce Request Handler
- Handle message batches
- Coordinate with indexing pipeline
- Write segments to object storage
- Implement acks behavior

### Task 10: Implement Fetch Request Handler
- Serve data from memory or object storage
- Handle offset management
- Support efficient range queries

## Architecture Highlights

1. **Licensing Compliance**: All dependencies are MIT/Apache 2.0 licensed
2. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between protocol, storage, and processing
3. **Cloud-Native**: Built-in support for major cloud object stores
4. **Type Safety**: Leveraging Rust's type system throughout
5. **Performance**: Zero-copy operations where possible, efficient serialization

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for storage and protocol
- Property-based testing planned for protocol edge cases
- Benchmark suite planned for performance validation
