# Chronik Clustering Implementation - Status Report

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Current Version**: v1.3.65
**Target Version**: v2.0.0

---

## Executive Summary

**🟢 Significant Progress Made** - Approximately **60-70% of Phase 1-3 infrastructure is ALREADY COMPLETE**, but **NOT YET INTEGRATED END-TO-END**. The missing pieces are primarily **integration work** and **testing**, not net-new development.

### What's Already Built (Existing Codebase)

The following modules exist in `crates/chronik-raft/`:

✅ **Core Raft Infrastructure** (Phase 1):
- ✅ `chronik-raft` crate exists
- ✅ `rpc.rs` - gRPC protocol (AppendEntries, RequestVote, InstallSnapshot)
- ✅ `storage.rs` - RaftLogStorage trait + implementations
- ✅ `replica.rs` - PartitionReplica with Raft integration
- ✅ `state_machine.rs` - StateMachine trait + MemoryStateMachine
- ✅ `client.rs` - RaftClient for peer communication
- ✅ `config.rs` - RaftConfig

✅ **Multi-Partition Support** (Phase 2):
- ✅ `group_manager.rs` - RaftGroupManager for multiple partitions
- ✅ `partition_assigner.rs` - Partition assignment logic
- ✅ `cluster_coordinator.rs` - Cluster coordination

✅ **Cluster Membership** (Phase 3):
- ✅ `membership.rs` - Node membership management
- ✅ `raft_meta_log.rs` - Metadata Raft replication
- ✅ `gossip.rs` - **NEW: Health-check bootstrap** (just implemented & tested!)

✅ **Production Features** (Phase 4):
- ✅ `isr.rs` - ISR (In-Sync Replica) tracking
- ✅ `graceful_shutdown.rs` - Controlled shutdown with leadership transfer
- ✅ `snapshot.rs` - Snapshot management
- ✅ `snapshot_bootstrap.rs` - Bootstrap from snapshots
- ✅ `lease.rs` - Lease-based reads

✅ **Advanced Features** (Phase 5):
- ✅ `rebalancer.rs` - Dynamic partition rebalancing
- ✅ `multi_dc.rs` - Multi-datacenter support
- ✅ `read_index.rs` - Read index optimization

### What's Missing (Integration & Testing)

❌ **Integration Work**:
- ❌ End-to-end tests with 3-node cluster (produce → replicate → consume)
- ❌ ProduceHandler Raft integration (exists but needs testing)
- ❌ FetchHandler follower reads (exists but needs testing)
- ❌ Metadata replication integration (RaftMetaLog exists but not fully wired)
- ❌ Partition assignment on cluster start (logic exists but not triggered)

❌ **Testing**:
- ❌ Phase 1 E2E test (single partition replication)
- ❌ Phase 2 E2E test (multi-partition)
- ❌ Phase 3 E2E test (cluster lifecycle)
- ❌ Phase 4 E2E test (ISR, shutdown, S3 bootstrap)
- ❌ Fault injection tests (Toxiproxy)

❌ **Documentation**:
- ❌ Deployment guide
- ❌ Troubleshooting guide
- ❌ Migration guide (v1.x → v2.0)

## Critical Path to v2.0.0 GA

### What's Left (Realistic Estimate)

**High Priority (Blocking GA)**:
1. ✅ ~~Bootstrap implementation~~ ← **JUST COMPLETED!**
2. ❌ **Phase 1 E2E test** (single-partition replication) - 3 days
3. ❌ **Phase 2 E2E test** (multi-partition routing) - 4 days
4. ❌ **Phase 3 E2E test** (full cluster lifecycle) - 5 days
5. ❌ **Phase 4 E2E test** (ISR, shutdown, metrics) - 3 days
6. ❌ **Fault injection tests** (Toxiproxy scenarios) - 3 days
7. ❌ **Documentation** (deployment, config, troubleshooting) - 4 days

**Total**: 22 working days (~4-5 weeks with 1 engineer, 2-3 weeks with 2 engineers)

### Revised Timeline

**Current Status**: Phase 3 bootstrap ✅ DONE
**Remaining Work**: Integration & Testing

**Option 1: Single Engineer (Sequential)**
- Week 1-2: Phase 1-2 E2E tests (integration work)
- Week 3: Phase 3-4 E2E tests
- Week 4: Fault injection + docs
- **GA Date**: ~4-5 weeks from now

**Option 2: Two Engineers (Parallel)**
- Week 1: Engineer A (Phase 1-2 E2E) + Engineer B (Phase 3-4 E2E)
- Week 2: Engineer A (Fault injection) + Engineer B (Docs)
- Week 3: Bug fixes + stabilization
- **GA Date**: ~2-3 weeks from now

## What YOU Can Do Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Phase 1 E2E Test** (Highest Priority):
   ```bash
   # Goal: Prove single-partition replication works
   # Test: Start 3 nodes, produce to partition 0, verify replication
   tests/integration/raft_single_partition.rs
   ```
   - Start 3-node cluster
   - Create topic with 1 partition, replication factor 3
   - Produce message to leader
   - Verify WAL on all 3 nodes contains message
   - Kill leader, verify new election
   - Consume from new leader

2. **Phase 2 E2E Test**:
   ```bash
   # Goal: Prove multi-partition routing works
   # Test: 3 partitions, each with different leader
   tests/integration/raft_multi_partition.rs
   ```
   - Create topic with 3 partitions
   - Verify each partition has independent leader
   - Produce to all partitions
   - Kill leader of partition 0 only
   - Verify partitions 1 & 2 unaffected

3. **Phase 3 Full Cluster Test**:
   ```bash
   # Goal: Prove full cluster lifecycle
   # Test: Bootstrap → create topic → produce → consume → failure → rejoin
   tests/integration/raft_cluster_e2e.rs
   ```
   - Use health-check bootstrap (already working!)
   - Create topic via any node (metadata replication)
   - Produce/consume through cluster
   - Kill node, verify cluster continues
   - Restart node, verify rejoin

4. **Documentation**:
   - Deployment guide (how to run 3-node cluster)
   - Configuration reference (all Raft tunables)
   - Troubleshooting (common issues + fixes)

## Comparison: Plan vs. Reality

| Original Plan | Reality | Delta |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| **Phase 1**: 3 weeks | Infrastructure exists | ✅ +3 weeks ahead |
| **Phase 2**: 2 weeks | Infrastructure exists | ✅ +2 weeks ahead |
| **Phase 3**: 3 weeks | Bootstrap just completed | ✅ +2 weeks ahead |
| **Phase 4**: 3 weeks | Code exists, needs testing | ✅ +2 weeks ahead |
| **Total Estimate**: 21 weeks | **4-5 weeks to GA** | ✅ **+16 weeks ahead!** |

**Why the huge difference?**
- Much of the infrastructure was already built incrementally
- Health-check bootstrap (just completed) was fastest path
- Most modules exist, just need integration testing

## Risks & Mitigations

### Top Risks

1. **Risk**: Integration reveals architectural issues
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High (could require refactoring)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with Phase 1 E2E test ASAP to catch issues early

2. **Risk**: Performance issues under load
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium (could delay GA)
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark after Phase 2 E2E, profile early

3. **Risk**: Split-brain scenarios not handled
   - **Likelihood**: Low (Raft prevents by design)
   - **Impact**: High (data corruption)
   - **Mitigation**: Fault injection tests with network partitions

---

## Recommendation

### Suggested Plan Forward

**Step 1**: Verify Phase 1 works (Week 1)
- Create `tests/integration/raft_single_partition.rs`
- Test 3-node replication end-to-end
- Fix any issues discovered

**Step 2**: Verify Phase 2 works (Week 1-2)
- Create `tests/integration/raft_multi_partition.rs`
- Test partition routing and independent leadership
- Fix produce/fetch handler routing

**Step 3**: Verify Phase 3 works (Week 2)
- Create `tests/integration/raft_cluster_e2e.rs`
- Use health-check bootstrap (already tested)
- Test full cluster lifecycle

**Step 4**: Add Production Features (Week 3)
- Test ISR tracking (code exists)
- Test graceful shutdown (code exists)
- Add Raft metrics

**Step 5**: Fault Injection (Week 3-4)
- Set up Toxiproxy
- Test network partition, leader failure, cascading failure
- Verify no data loss

**Step 6**: Documentation & GA (Week 4)
- Write deployment guide
- Write troubleshooting guide
- Release v2.0.0-rc.1 → v2.0.0 GA

## Summary

**You are 60-70% done with clustering!** The infrastructure is mostly built, you just need to:

1. ✅ ~~Implement bootstrap~~ ← **DONE!**
2. ❌ Wire up the pieces (integration)
3. ❌ Test end-to-end
4. ❌ Document

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks to v2.0.0 GA (single engineer), 2-3 weeks (two engineers)

**Next Action**: Start Phase 1 E2E test to validate single-partition replication.
