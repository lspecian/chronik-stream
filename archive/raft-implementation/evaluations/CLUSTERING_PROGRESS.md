   - ✅ Peer discovery timing fixed (pre-populated from cluster config)
   - ✅ Empty peer lists issue resolved
   - **Current**: Testing multi-node cluster with all fixes applied
2. **Integration Testing** (2-3 days):

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ **2025-10-15**: Use `raft-rs` (TiKV's Raft) - battle-tested, feature-complete
- ✅ **2025-10-15**: Multi-Raft (one per partition + one for metadata)
- ✅ **2025-10-15**: gRPC for inter-node communication
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: WAL implements `RaftLogStorage` directly (no duplication)

### Implementation Decisions
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: `CLUSTER_PEERS` format is `host:kafka_port:raft_port` (not `node_id:host:port`)
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: Test suite uses native binaries (not Docker) on macOS
- ✅ **2025-10-17 Evening**: FetchHandler strategy = **follower reads** (Option A) for 3x scalability

### Process Decisions
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: Use parallel agents for independent work streams
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: Update this doc daily with progress
- ✅ **2025-10-17**: "Correctness over speed" - test thoroughly before moving on

## 🔄 Change Log

### 2025-10-18 (Clustering Integration - ONGOING) - **🔄 METADATA REPLICATION NEEDED**
- **Started**: Testing and fixing multi-node cluster formation
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Auto-derive metrics/search API ports from Kafka port
  - Metrics port = kafka_port + 2 (e.g., 9092 → 9094, 9192 → 9194)
  - Search port = kafka_port - 3000 (e.g., 9092 → 6092, 9192 → 6192)
  - Only applies in cluster mode, standalone unchanged
  - Files modified: `main.rs`, `cli/cluster.rs`
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Pre-populate peer lists from cluster config
  - Added `initial_peers: Vec<u64>` to `RaftManagerConfig`
  - Peer list populated at startup from cluster config
  - Eliminates async peer discovery delay
  - Files modified: `raft_integration.rs`, `main.rs`, `raft_cluster.rs`
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Fix clustering mode detection
  - Auto-enable when `CHRONIK_CLUSTER_PEERS` is set (no need for explicit `CHRONIK_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true`)
  - Updated `ClusterConfig::from_env()` to detect peers and auto-enable
  - Updated `is_cluster_mode` check in `main.rs`
  - Files modified: `chronik-config/src/cluster.rs`, `chronik-server/src/main.rs`
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Fix test script metrics port configuration
  - Removed explicit `CHRONIK_METRICS_PORT` env var to allow auto-derivation
  - Files modified: `test_raft_cluster_lifecycle_e2e.py`
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Raft gRPC peer connectivity working
  - Node 1 successfully connected to Node 2 and 3
  - Node 2 successfully connected to Node 1 and 3
  - All nodes report successful Raft peer connections
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Broker metadata replication network integration (Phase 3.3)
  - **Changes Made** (2025-10-18):
    1. Created `RaftMetaLog::from_replica()` constructor to accept existing PartitionReplica
    2. Modified `integrated_server.rs` to create `__meta` replica via RaftReplicaManager
    3. Modified `raft_cluster.rs` to create `__meta` replica and use `from_replica()`
    4. __meta partition now registered with Raft gRPC service ✅
    5. Added 5-second timeout to `propose_and_wait()` in RaftMetaLog
    6. Made broker registration async with background retry in integrated_server.rs
  - **Current Issue**: Metadata reads return empty results during bootstrap
  - **Root Cause**: Raft won't commit entries without quorum (2/3 nodes), so `local_state` stays empty
  - **Impact**: Kafka metadata requests timeout because `list_brokers()` returns empty list
  - **Analysis**: Nodes start successfully, but Raft entries remain uncommitted until quorum achieved
  - **Solution Needed**:
    - Option A: Start with single-node Raft, add peers via configuration change
    - Option B: Allow reads from uncommitted Raft log during bootstrap
    - Option C: Use temporary FileMetadataStore until quorum achieved, then migrate
  - **Files to review**: `raft_meta_log.rs` (BackgroundProcessor), `replica.rs` (single-node bootstrap)
- **Current Task**: Resolve Raft quorum requirement for metadata reads during bootstrap
- **Status**: Network connected ✅, async registration ✅, needs bootstrap quorum strategy
