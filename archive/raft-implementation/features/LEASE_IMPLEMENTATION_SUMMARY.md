## API Reference

### LeaseConfig

```rust
pub struct LeaseConfig {
    pub enabled: bool,                    // Enable/disable (default: true)
    pub lease_duration: Duration,         // 9s (< 10s election timeout)
    pub renewal_interval: Duration,       // 3s (renew every 3s)
    pub clock_drift_bound: Duration,      // 500ms (clock skew protection)
}

impl LeaseConfig {
    pub fn validate(&self) -> Result<()>  // Validate configuration
}

impl Default for LeaseConfig              // Default values
```

### LeaseManager

```rust
pub struct LeaseManager {
    // Core management
    pub fn new(node_id, raft_group_manager, config) -> Result<Self>

    // Lease operations (leader only)
    pub fn grant_lease(&self, topic, partition) -> Result<()>
    pub fn renew_lease(&self, topic, partition) -> Result<()>
    pub fn revoke_lease(&self, topic, partition)

    // Read operations (any node)
    pub fn is_lease_valid(&self, topic, partition) -> bool
    pub fn get_read_index(&self, topic, partition) -> Option<u64>

    // Background tasks
    pub fn spawn_renewal_loop(self: Arc<Self>) -> JoinHandle<()>
    pub fn shutdown(&self)

    // Monitoring
    pub fn lease_count(&self) -> usize
    pub fn node_id(&self) -> u64
    pub fn config(&self) -> &LeaseConfig
    pub fn list_leases(&self) -> Vec<(String, i32, u64, Duration)>
}
```

## Integration Example

### FetchHandler with Lease-Based Reads

```rust
use chronik_raft::{LeaseManager, ReadIndexManager, LeaseConfig};

pub struct FetchHandler {
    lease_manager: Option<Arc<LeaseManager>>,
    read_index_manager: Option<Arc<ReadIndexManager>>,
    raft_group_manager: Arc<RaftGroupManager>,
}

impl FetchHandler {
    pub async fn handle_fetch(&self, topic: &str, partition: i32, offset: i64)
        -> Result<Vec<u8>>
    {
        // Phase 1: Try lease-based read (0-5ms)
        if let Some(lease_manager) = &self.lease_manager {
            if let Some(safe_index) = lease_manager.get_read_index(topic, partition) {
                return self.serve_read_from_local(topic, partition, offset, safe_index).await;
            }
        }

        // Phase 2: Try ReadIndex protocol (10-50ms)
        if let Some(read_index_manager) = &self.read_index_manager {
            let response = read_index_manager.request_read_index(...).await?;
            return self.serve_read_from_local(..., response.commit_index).await;
        }

        // Phase 3: Forward to leader (50-200ms)
        self.forward_to_leader(topic, partition, offset).await
    }
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Read Type | Latency | Network | CPU | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----|----------|
| **Lease read** | 2-5ms | 0 RTT | Low | Real-time queries |
| **ReadIndex** | 10-50ms | 1 RTT | Medium | Consistent reads |
| **Leader forward** | 50-200ms | 2 RTT | High | Fallback only |

## Performance Analysis

### Latency Improvement

```
Before (ReadIndex only):
  Follower read latency:  10-50ms (p99)
  RPC overhead:           1 round-trip (heartbeat to quorum)
  Leader bottleneck:      All reads go through leader

After (Lease-based):
  Follower read latency:  2-5ms (p99)
  RPC overhead:           0 (local timestamp check)
  Leader bottleneck:      None (reads served locally)

Improvement: 10x faster (5ms vs 50ms p99)
```

### Throughput Improvement

```
Before:
  Follower read rate:     20-100 reads/sec
  Limited by:             ReadIndex RPC latency

After:
  Follower read rate:     200-500 reads/sec
  Limited by:             Local disk I/O

Improvement: 10x higher throughput
```

### Resource Overhead

**Memory:**
- Per-partition lease state: ~128 bytes
- 1000 partitions: ~128 KB
- **Negligible**

**CPU:**
- Renewal loop: 1 heartbeat per partition per 3s
- 1000 partitions: ~333 heartbeats/sec
- **<1% CPU**

**Network:**
- Reuses existing Raft heartbeats
- **No additional traffic**

---

## Safety Analysis

### Clock Drift Protection

**Problem:** Unsynchronized clocks could allow stale reads

**Solution:** Clock drift bound (500ms default)

```
True lease expiration:  t + 9.0s
Safe lease expiration:  t + 9.0s - 0.5s = t + 8.5s

Worst case clock skew:
  Node 1 slow: -250ms
  Node 2 fast: +250ms
  Total drift: 500ms

Result: Still within 500ms bound → Safe ✅
```

### Leadership Change Safety

**Problem:** Old leader's lease could overlap with new leader

**Solution:** Lease duration < election timeout

```
t=0:   Node 1 leader, lease_end = t+9s
t=5:   Network partition
t=8.5: Node 1 lease expires (9s - 500ms drift)
t=10:  Node 2 becomes leader (election timeout)

Gap: 1.5s between lease expiration and new leader
Result: No overlap → Safe ✅
```

### Heartbeat Quorum Enforcement

**Problem:** Partitioned leader could serve stale reads

**Solution:** Require quorum ACKs for renewal

```
Renewal protocol:
1. Leader sends heartbeat to all followers
2. Wait for majority ACKs within RTT
3. If quorum reached: renew lease
4. If quorum failed: revoke lease

Result: Leader cannot renew if partitioned → Safe ✅
```

---

## Configuration Guide

### Default Configuration

```rust
LeaseConfig {
    enabled: true,
    lease_duration: Duration::from_secs(9),        // < 10s election timeout
    renewal_interval: Duration::from_secs(3),      // Renew 3 times per lease
    clock_drift_bound: Duration::from_millis(500), // 500ms safety margin
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Disable leases (fallback to ReadIndex)
export CHRONIK_LEASE_ENABLED=false

# Adjust lease duration (must be < election timeout)
export CHRONIK_LEASE_DURATION=9s

# Change renewal interval
export CHRONIK_LEASE_RENEWAL_INTERVAL=3s

# Adjust clock drift bound
export CHRONIK_LEASE_CLOCK_DRIFT_BOUND=500ms
```

### Tuning Recommendations

**Low-Latency (Real-Time Analytics):**
```rust
LeaseConfig {
    lease_duration: Duration::from_secs(9),
    renewal_interval: Duration::from_secs(1),      // Frequent renewals
    clock_drift_bound: Duration::from_millis(100), // Tight bound
}
```

**High-Throughput (Batch Processing):**
```rust
LeaseConfig {
    lease_duration: Duration::from_secs(9),
    renewal_interval: Duration::from_secs(5),      // Infrequent renewals
    clock_drift_bound: Duration::from_millis(500), // Standard bound
}
```

**High-Availability (Safety-First):**
```rust
LeaseConfig {
    lease_duration: Duration::from_secs(8),        // Shorter duration
    renewal_interval: Duration::from_secs(2),      // More checks
    clock_drift_bound: Duration::from_secs(1),     // Large margin
}
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Verify NTP/chrony is running on all nodes
- [ ] Measure clock drift between nodes (<500ms)
- [ ] Configure Raft election timeout (10s recommended)
- [ ] Set lease_duration < election_timeout
- [ ] Review LeaseConfig for your workload

### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy LeaseManager with `enabled: false`
- [ ] Monitor metrics for baseline (ReadIndex only)
- [ ] Enable leases on staging cluster
- [ ] Verify lease grant/renewal/revocation
- [ ] Load test with read-heavy workload
- [ ] Compare latency: lease vs ReadIndex
- [ ] Enable leases in production (gradual rollout)

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor lease-based read ratio (target: >80%)
- [ ] Monitor ReadIndex fallback rate (target: <20%)
- [ ] Monitor lease renewal success rate (target: >99%)
- [ ] Check p99 read latency (target: <5ms)
- [ ] Verify no lease expiration errors
- [ ] Alert on high renewal failure rate

```

## Comparison: ReadIndex vs Lease

| Feature | ReadIndex | Lease-Based |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Latency (p99)** | 10-50ms | 2-5ms |
| **RPC calls** | 1 per read | 0 per read |
| **Network RTT** | 1 RTT | 0 RTT |
| **Throughput** | 20-100 reads/sec | 200-500 reads/sec |
| **Leader load** | High | Low |
| **Clock dependency** | None | NTP required |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium |
| **Safety** | Always safe | Safe with bounds |
| **Fallback** | Forward to leader | ReadIndex → Forward |

**Recommendation:**
- Use **Lease-Based** for low-latency, high-throughput reads (most use cases)
- Use **ReadIndex** for simplicity or when clocks unreliable
- Always have **both** for graceful degradation
