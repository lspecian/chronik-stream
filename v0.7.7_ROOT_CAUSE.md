# CRITICAL BUG: v0.7.6 Regression Root Cause Analysis

## Executive Summary
**90% message loss caused by segments not being read after flush**

## The Real Problem
Messages are successfully written to disk segments but the fetch handler cannot read them back. The fetch logs show `max_segment_offset=-1` which means segments are not being accessed at all.

## Message Flow (What's Happening)

### ✅ Produce Phase (Working)
1. Message arrives → Added to buffer
2. Buffer reaches threshold (4 messages) → Triggers flush
3. Flush writes messages to segment files on disk
4. mark_flushed() removes messages from memory buffer

### ❌ Fetch Phase (BROKEN)
1. Consumer requests messages
2. Fetch checks buffer → Empty (messages were flushed)
3. Fetch should check segments → **FAILS** (max_segment_offset=-1)
4. Result: No messages returned to consumer

## Evidence from Logs

```
PRODUCE→BUFFER: Sending 1 records to buffer for test-fix-602288ce-0
FLUSH→START: Starting flush for test-fix-602288ce-0
FLUSH→COMPLETE: Removed 4 flushed records, 0 records remain

FETCH→BUFFER: Checking buffer for test-fix-602288ce-0, 
              buffer has 0 records,
              max_segment_offset=-1,  ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
              high_watermark=5
```

The `-1` value for max_segment_offset indicates segments are not being read.

## Why This Happened

The v0.7.6 changes focused on fixing duplication in the buffer layer but inadvertently broke segment reading. When messages are flushed from memory to disk, they become inaccessible because the segment reader is not properly initialized or connected.

## The Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Not Recommended)
- Don't remove messages from buffer after flush
- Keep them in memory until consumed
- Problem: High memory usage, not scalable

### Option 2: Proper Fix (Recommended)
- Fix segment reader initialization
- Ensure segments are properly indexed after flush
- Make fetch handler read from segments when buffer is empty
- This maintains the intended architecture

## Version History
- v0.7.4: 70% loss - Partial segment issues
- v0.7.5: 80% duplication - Buffer duplication
- v0.7.6: 90% loss - Segments completely broken
- v0.7.7: Must fix segment reading

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Find why max_segment_offset is -1
2. Check segment reader initialization
3. Verify segment files are being created
4. Fix the connection between flush and segment reading
