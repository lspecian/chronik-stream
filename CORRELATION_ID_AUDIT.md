# Correlation ID Audit Report

## Summary
Audit of error response paths in Chronik Stream to ensure correlation IDs are properly preserved throughout the error handling flow.

## Findings

### ✅ Properly Handling Correlation IDs

1. **Protocol Handler** (`crates/chronik-protocol/src/handler.rs`)
   - `error_response()` function accepts `correlation_id` parameter
   - All error paths use this function correctly
   - Unknown API handling preserves correlation ID

2. **Kafka Handler** (`crates/chronik-ingest/src/kafka_handler.rs`)
   - All API responses include `ResponseHeader { correlation_id }`
   - Error handling for unknown APIs preserves correlation ID
   - All match arms properly propagate correlation ID

3. **Produce Handler** (`crates/chronik-ingest/src/produce_handler.rs`)
   - `handle_produce()` accepts `correlation_id` parameter
   - All error responses (timeout, storage error, processing error) include correlation ID
   - Response structure always includes `ResponseHeader { correlation_id }`

4. **Fetch Handler** (`crates/chronik-ingest/src/fetch_handler.rs`)
   - `handle_fetch()` accepts `correlation_id` parameter
   - Response includes `ResponseHeader { correlation_id }`
   - Error codes properly set for various conditions

### ⚠️ Areas of Concern

1. **Consumer Group Manager** (`crates/chronik-ingest/src/consumer_group.rs`)
   - Response structures include error_code but are internal
   - These are wrapped by kafka_handler which adds correlation ID
   - No direct issue but relies on proper wrapping

2. **Error Code Constants**
   - Magic numbers used in some places (e.g., 35 for UNSUPPORTED_VERSION)
   - Should use named constants for clarity

### 🔍 Patterns Observed

1. **Consistent Response Structure**
   ```rust
   Response {
       header: ResponseHeader { correlation_id },
       body: encoded_response
   }
   ```

2. **Error Response Pattern**
   ```rust
   fn error_response(&self, correlation_id: i32, error_code: i16) -> Result<Response>
   ```

3. **Handler Pattern**
   - All handlers accept correlation_id as parameter
   - All responses include ResponseHeader with correlation_id

## Recommendations

1. **No Critical Issues Found** - All major error paths properly preserve correlation IDs

2. **Minor Improvements**:
   - Replace magic error code numbers with named constants
   - Consider creating an ErrorResponse builder for consistency
   - Add integration tests for error scenarios

3. **Best Practices Already Followed**:
   - Correlation ID is passed explicitly to all handlers
   - Response structure enforces correlation ID inclusion
   - Error handling is centralized where possible

## Conclusion

The codebase already properly handles correlation IDs in error responses. The fix implemented in Task 69 addressed the main issue with unknown APIs, and all other error paths were already correctly preserving correlation IDs.

No additional changes are required for correlation ID preservation in error responses.
